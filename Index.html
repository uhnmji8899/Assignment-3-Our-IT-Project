    <p>Hello everyone! My full name is Bui Hoang, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hanoi. Right now, I study a Bachelor of Information of Technology at RMIT Vietnam but before that, I was a student of Hanoi University of Science. I enjoy playing video games and playing soccer with my friends in my free time. I had my first PC when I was 5, so I have approached the computer from a very early. Then, instead of hanging out to the street, I spent all day playing videos game and exploring my PC. For me, that time in part build my IT interests. Before I go to RMIT, I don’t have any experience in IT major but I believe that I will have a good knowledge of IT ecosystems and able to use all common program languages. </p>

    </div>

    <h2>PROJECT</h2>

    <h3>PROJECT DECRIPTION</h3>

    <h4>What does it do ?</h4>

    <p> Our project will be focusing on the concept of VR gaming. So what is VR in the first place? VR stands for virtual reality and refers to the creation of technology that allows users to engage in an artificial and fictional world. Virtual reality is used for many different purposes, such as gaming, entertainment, and even education. However, for our project, we will go deeper into the art of virtual reality gaming. Based on the concept of a 3D dimensional world, VR gaming gives the players a realistic and mesmerizing experience of an action game. The players can choose their preferred platform to encounter the new definition of gaming. VR gaming comes in different forms, where users can play on their PCs or laptops, gaming consoles such as PS4 and Xbox, and their smartphones. Moreover, for VR gaming to work, players must possess a majority of devices and accessories such as VR headsets and Goggles, along with controllers and gloves. By putting these devices on, the player won’t be able to differentiate between the real world and the virtual world when their senses have now converted and linked with the 3D world so that they can have the most realistic gaming experience ever.  </p>

    <h4>What it likely to impact ?</h4>

    <p>With the development of technology rising rapidly day by day, the concept of gaming is expanded with the lights of virtual reality. VR positive has influenced the gaming industry heavily and changed the way it operates. First of all, with developing VR into video games, it creates more job opportunities for the game developers as there’s a new area to focus and research on. As a result, it would mean no redundancy of current workers and along with more games designer and developer being recruited into the company to exploit the VR software further. Second of all, with virtual reality trending in the gaming industry, it attracts brands and businesses to invest and identify new gaps and opportunities. An example of this scenario would be Mountain Dews sponsoring famous streamers when they play games using virtual reality technology. Furthermore, by installing VR into the gameplay of new action games, it opens up a new spin for gamers to take on as VR injects its own unique plot and storyline of the game, hence allowing gamers to immerse themselves in the virtual world fully. An example of popular games introducing VR into its gameplay is League of Legends, releasing their new patch that includes a 360-degree view VR arena mode.</p>

    <h4>How will this affect you? </h4>

    <p>As for myself, I had a recent experience with VR gaming when I take part in an action game, firing different kinds of weapons through holding a controller and wearing a VR headset. The experience was one of a kind and very surreal as I felt like I’m in my world, walking through a storyline of my own and controlling the progression of the game as it goes.  </p>

    <h4>Gameplay</h4>

    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

    <h4>Topic </h4>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>

    <p>All our group members love to play video games so as a reason, we all agreed that our project will be a video game. Moreover, the demand for people to entertain in their own houses is more and more increase nowadays, especially at this time. Because of the corona outbreak, people have to spend almost all their time at their house so games are a good way to entertain.  </p>

    <p>We chose our project will be a Virtual Reality game because of the reasons below: </p>

    <p>The new age of Virtual Reality has started with its application in many major and especially in Gaming. Many famous games with millions of player can be proof for the success of Virtual Reality Gaming (VR Gaming): </p>

    <p>Secondly, we all agree that the perfect way to tell a story for people is that make them join to that story. And VR Gaming is a good way to help the player completely become a character in a story.   </p>

    <div class="">

      <p>We can see how people enter to their characters mind while playing VR Games</p>
    </div>

    <p>For all the reasons that we gave above, we chose VR Game as our Project in Assignment 3.</p>

    <h4>Landscape</h4>

    <p>We believe that Half–Life : Alyx has some similar points with our project.</p>

    <div class="">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2W0N3uKXmo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx Announcement Trailer</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are many  VR games in the gaming market currently and it is a big competitive market. Half-Life: Alyx is one of the most prominent VR games which have interesting gameplay and amazing story. But the difference between other games are their gameplay and the game’s story, our group believe that we have an interesting game’s story and gameplay that can attract players. Moreover, our game project adds the coop function that helps players can play with their friends and explore the game together. Furthermore, Our project want to develop in both console version and PC version.

    <h2>TECHNOLOGIES AND TESTING </h2>

    <h3>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES </h3>

    <h4> Hardware</h4>

    <p>In a VR world, VR Headset (eg. Oculus Quest, Sony Playstation VR)  is a critical item for players to play VR games. This equipment plays as a role like a key to connect people from the real world to VR</p>

    <h4> Software</h4>

    <p>Unity 3D Pro( Version 2020.1.5) or Unreal Engine 4(Version 4.25) is our first choice of software tools for this project. Both of them are the most popular engines for game developers and they also have good support for VR games.   </p>

    <p>Currently, all members of our group don’t have any practical experience and core technology knowledge in writing VR software or VR game, so we need to spend a lot of time learning tools, technologies, and programing language to develop our game. </p>

    <h3>TESTING</h3>

    <p>The first testing way we use that we need to play our game. By checking the game ourselves, we can check the gameplay, graphic of our game, and if the game is run fluently as we expected. Each of us will give feedback for the game and discuss it together. Then, we can find out bugs in the game and quickly fix it. </p>

    <p>Secondly, to complete the game we also have to receive ideas and comments from other players. At that point,  we will spend the demo version of our game on the official website so people can download and play it for free. We will also send our game to forums and communities on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. The discussions in their places can help us improve our game. Then, the more testers, the better. The feedback we received from people will help us fix bugs and mistakes that we didn’t note.  </p>

    <p>Furthermore, we can introduce our game to people by joining in game festivals. Customers can play our game in VR places in game festivals and review the game for us.  </p>

    <h3>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATIONS </h3>

    <p>Throughtout the project, our group’s communications were used 2 platforms: </p>

    <b>Facebook Messenger </b>

    <p>Facebook is a common social network in Vietnam and we all have a Facebook account. As a result, we use Facebook Messenger as a good platform to communicate about daily talks. </p>

    <b>Discord </b>

    <p>A convenient online platform that helps us to make our own server to host a  communicate by video call and posting our work in that server at home. We also can stream our laptop screen in this platform to show the task’s project problems without meetings so that is very convenient for the group discussion. Moreover, we can able to play video games together to break the walls and really be comfortable with one another here, which allows for more effective communication. </p>

    <b>Meetings</b>

    <p>Even though we have a platform for the group’s communications, we still believe that meetings are really important for the project. All our big discussion  and our tasks distribution are in meetings. We all feed that the work will be more productive and quickly while working face to face.  </p>
